Description:

This project dives into the fundamentals of Node.js, exploring core concepts like:

* Running JavaScript code using Node.js
* Utilizing Node.js modules (both built-in and third-party)
* Reading files using the `fs` module
* Accessing command-line arguments and environment variables with the `process` object
* Creating HTTP servers with the `http` module and Express.js
* Defining advanced routes in Express.js
* Leveraging ES6 features with Node.js using Babel
* Speeding up development with Nodemon

Learning Objectives:

* Execute JavaScript code directly on your computer using Node.js.
* Leverage built-in and external Node.js modules to extend functionality.
* Read and write files using the `fs` module.
* Access and utilize command-line arguments and environment variables.
* Create basic and more complex HTTP servers using Node.js's `http` module.
* Build web applications and APIs with Express.js, including advanced routing.
* Write modern JavaScript code with ES6 features, ensuring compatibility with older Node.js versions using Babel.
* Improve your development workflow by using Nodemon for automatic server restarts.
